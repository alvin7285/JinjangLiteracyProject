          <h4 class="aboutUsContent">HELP has in the past offered quite a few
            English language workshops for various groups of people. At the
            moment we are running a project called Project SELF-HELP in
            cooperation with the UNHCR for refugees who want to improve their
            English language and upgrade their skills. These English language
            projects are part of our Corporate Social Responsibility
            initiatives, and reflects one of HELP’s core values which is
            “To be Compassionate”. We have embarked on the English programmes to
            help these young children so that they may have a brighter future.</h4>

          <h4 class="aboutUsContent">AGN was set up as a Non Profit Organization
             to comfort and reach out with compassion, to the poor, needy,

              encourage, particularly the urban poor through access to education,
              health, child sponsorship and food distribution. Through their
              members who are all volunteers, they work tirelessly with the
              families in the community to ensure the young gets a chance to
               break the vicious cycle of poverty through education.</h4>
